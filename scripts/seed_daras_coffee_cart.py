TASK_PROMPT = """Dara is a student. She has saved enough to buy one coffee cart, and she has a licence to trade on campus. She has not decided what to sell, what to charge, where to park, or how anyone will find out she exists. She has asked you to decide, and to explain your reasoning to her.

### What it costs and what the competition charges:
• €0.80 — What one cup costs Dara to make (beans, milk, cup, lid)
• €45 — Cart licence, per week
• €3.20 — What the campus café charges for a coffee
• 9,000 — Total students on campus

### Where she could park:
1. Library steps: 1,200 people passing per day | 4 minutes walk to the café
2. Science block: 700 people passing per day | 11 minutes walk to the café
3. Sports centre: 400 people passing per day | 14 minutes walk to the café (nothing else sold there)

### What students said (Survey of 200 students):
• 62% would buy coffee between classes if it were closer than the café
• 41% would pay more for oat milk
• 28% only drink tea

The catch: Dara has one cart and can only be in one place at a time.

### The Task:
Write about 400 words advising Dara. Your advice must cover what she sells (Product), what she charges (Price), where she parks (Place), and how students find out the cart exists (Promotion) — but how you organise it is your decision.

Every one of the four decisions must be made and defended. Telling her what she could do is not advising her. Where the case does not tell you something, assume it, say you have assumed it, and carry on."""
